Restaurant Database + Logic Model + Conceptual Model + Requirements 

For this project it is intended to create a database that supports the day-to-day work of a restaurant, however it is only intended to illustrate sectors such as the kitchen, warehouse, suppliers and some activities inherent to these sectors. 
This database should store information such as stock of products, orders placed by the kitchen and employees, validity of your products, etc.
